# SEI-Project-1

### Hangman

### Description
This application will take in a word entered by a user and will hide the word when entered. Blank spaces will appear denoting letters. The player will enter a letter and the letter will either be displayed if contained in the word, or it will be displayed in a box containing wrong guesses. As the player guesses wrong the hangman figure will gradually take shape until the player guesses the word or they are out of guesses.

### MVP
Application must allow user to input a word to be guessed, guess letters, and display an image showing the progression of guesses throughout the game. The most basic program should also indicate how many letters the word contains, and populate the blanks when the user has guessed letters correctly.

Post MVP - features nice to have would be allowing multiple words to be input with spaces, a random word generator, a reset button, and input validation to prevent users from breaking the program. Also nice to have would be perfected styling to give the app a nice clean appearance.

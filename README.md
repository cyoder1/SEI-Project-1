# SEI-Project-1

### Hangman

### Description
This application will take in a word endered by a user and will hide the word when entered. Blank spaces will appear denoting letters. The player will enter a letter and the letter will either be displayed if it is in the word, or it will be displayed in a box containing wrong guesses. As the player guesses wrong the hangman figure will gradually take shape until the player guesses the word or they are out of guesses.

### MVP
Application must allow user to input a word to be guessed, guess letters, and display an image showing the progression of guesses throughout the game. 

Post MVP - features nice to hace would be allowing multiple words to be input, a random word generator, a reset button, and input validation to prevent users from breaking the program. Also nice to have would be perfected styling to give the app a nice clean appearance.
